Merry Xmas!

Thank you for volunteering as Test Subject here at Xmas Labs. 
As always, we are super-excited to have you try out our latest creations.


HOW TO INSTALL DATAPACKS
------------------------
All you have to do is copy this zip file (or folder) into the 'datapacks' folder of your world save. 
Your world save is located in a folder called 'saves' in the '.minecraft' folder where the game is installed. 
The '.minecraft' folder is located in a tricky spot that may vary for different users. 
On Windows, it's usually located at [ C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft ] where USERNAME is... well.. your username.

Still confused? Just look it up online. It's quite simple really! 


WARNING
-------
There is ~0.000000000001% chance these can irreversibly destroy your world!
So please BACK UP YOUR SAVES before trying them out!

We're not taking responsibility for any chaos our inventions cause within your worlds.
Datapacks can be quite finicky sometimes, you know?


Lots of Love, 
Xmas Labs
